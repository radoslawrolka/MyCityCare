# MyCityCare

MyCityCare is an web application developed during the SWM Hackathon 2024, where it claimed the prestigious 2nd place. This application serves as a platform for citizens to submit various issues and concerns to their local governments, facilitating communication and problem-solving within cities.

 Despite its rapid development within a few hours, MyCityCare demonstrates its potential to streamline civic engagement and improve urban infrastructure by bridging the gap between citizens and authorities.
